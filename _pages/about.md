I am a Computational Biologist at [Cellzome / GSK](https://de.gsk.com).
During my academic career, I addressed a wide range of topics in molecular biology through the lens of modern omics techniques.
My doctoral research is centered around the analysis of multimodal single-cell data.
Specifically, I used single-cell transcriptome, methylome and chromatin accessibility data to demonstrate that DNA methylation underlies the stem cell capabilities of adult neural stem cells.
To make this study possible, I devised and implemented custom algorithms designed for the unique properties of single-cell methylation data.

In the past, I worked at the [Biostatistics for Omics Data group](https://www.bioquant.uni-heidelberg.de/groups/anders) of Simon Anders, the [Molecular Neurobiology group](https://martin-villalba-lab.github.io/) of Ana Martin-Villalba and the [Molecular Evolution and Bioinformatics group](https://bornberglab.org/) of Erich Bornberg-Bauer.
